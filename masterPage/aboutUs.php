                        People often ask us <strong><font color="b08458">"Did you really start 
                        Smart Store from your home garage?"</font></strong><br><br>
                        We Sure did! 11 years ago. We were renovating our house and
                        couldnâ€™t find any quality wardrobe products! We were
                        fairly disappointed.
                        We'd searched high and low. Driving all over town, from
                        store to store, looking for a wardrobe that had FLARE.
                        Something Modern, Flexible, Versatile. Something with
                        Style...<br><br>
                        But we'd end up driving home disappointed and frustrated.
                        The wardrobe we wanted, didn't exist.<br><br>
                        Not willing to give up, we started researching... And what
                        fascinated us, was how many people were exactly like us, in
                        the exact same position.
                        You had to deal with what the builder gave you... One shelf.
                        One Rail. And A LOT of wasted place.<br><br>
                        Go figure, eh? Kinda like this photo:</font></p><br><br>

                        What a nightmare, hey! Wasted space, messy as, and good luck
                        trying to find what you want to wear in the
                        morning!<br><br>
                        But it's cheap and easy for your builder!<br><br>
                        Anyway...<br><br>
                        We weren't very happy with that.<br><br></p></font>
    
                    <font size="5"><p align="justify">
                        And that's why we started <strong><font color="b08458">Smart Store!</font></strong></p></font>

                        Straight out of our home garage. Helping people create
                        modern and stylish wardrobes. And we took it seriously. We
                        wanted the best of the best, so that's what we committed to
                        giving our customers.<br><br>

                        To meeting manufacturers in Europe, the UK and
                        Asia.<br><br><br>
